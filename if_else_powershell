$status = $timesync.enabled

$false is postentially confusing, and as redundant as testing for $true. Instead of this:

if ($status -eq $False) {write-host "time service disabled"}
Else {write-host "time is enabled"}


I would recommend this:

if ($status) {
   write-host "time is enabled"
} Else {
   write-host "time service disabled"
}


If the flow of control is such that it would be more logical for the "false" code block to appear first, I'd change it to this:

if (-not $status) {
   write-host "time service disabled"
} Else {
   write-host "time is enabled"
}
